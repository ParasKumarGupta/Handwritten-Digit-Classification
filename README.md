# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
<h2>The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.</h2>

* Learn about the [MNIST handwritten digits dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* Use the [Keras API](https://keras.io/) to load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training
* Create a simple neural network to perform image classification
* Train the neural network using the prepped MNIST dataset
* Observe the performance of the trained neural network

In the history of deep learning, the accurate image classification of the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, was a major development. While today the problem is considered trivial, doing image classification with MNIST has become a kind of "Hello World" for deep learning.
